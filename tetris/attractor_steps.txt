    # Hard coded instructions for the attractor to follow
    # Every line should contain 1 character representing the command you want to be run
    # For movement commands(sideways movement, quick/hard drop, rotation) use the relevant keys
    # To specify what piece spawns, use the relevant number
    # To add delay, use any character that isn't an actual command, or use blank lines
    # Any command containing a '#' is skipped when running the attractor
